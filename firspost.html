    <h1>First post</h1>

    <p>Today it was the creation of the blog. As I mentioned before, here I will comment and express the process of creation of
        my first book about programming, which its title will be: Programming made easy. To contextualize a little bit, this
        book/guide will talk about certain ways in which we can learn programming faster. The whole guide/book will be based on 
        already proven learning and retention strategies. I hope you like this book, since it took me a long time to make it.
        Whatever, I'm already talking in future tense. This is the first post, which is kinda a introduction about certain topics
        that this blog will cover. I would try to be active as possible, however, I don't promise to just post things that are only 
        related to the creation of this book/guide. This was the first post.
